    "\n",
    "### The CARA Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, researchers grew Arabidopsis plants in space and measured their gene expression patterns to examine how different genotypes respond to the spaceflight environment. They looked at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two natural plant strains: **Col-0** and **WS**\n",
    "- A genetically modified version of Col-0 missing the **PhyD gene** (called the *PhyD mutant*)\n",
    "\n",
    "These plants were grown under two types of ISS environments:\n",
    "- **GC (Growth Chamber)** – a controlled, Earth-like light setting\n",
    "- **FLT (Flight Habitat)** – a more ambient, variable ISS setting\n",
    "\n",
    "### What They Found\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **light conditions**, both the **WS genotype** and the **PhyD mutant** showed **simpler transcriptome responses** (fewer genes turning on/off), compared to Col-0.\n",
    "- This suggests that tweaking a single gene—or using a different natural genotype—might actually help the plant adapt **more efficiently** by reducing the \"cost\" of adaptation.\n",
    "- In **dark conditions**, however, WS showed a **larger gene expression response**, suggesting that **light availability** plays a major role in how plants adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll work with **real RNAseq data** from this experiment (unnormalized counts), and explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which genes are expressed most in spaceflight\n",
    "- How expression changes across genotypes and environments\n",
    "- Whether simpler gene expression patterns might signal better adaptation\n",
